Q: How can JavaScript make decisions like using if statements in Python?

A: JavaScript uses similar logic with if statements to control the flow of code based on conditions.  We compared it to your Python experience.

Q: I wrote an if statement with num == 2, but something seems wrong.

A: That's right! In JavaScript, we use the strict comparison operator (===) for equality checks to avoid unexpected behavior.

Q:  Okay, so if (num === 2) checks for a strict equality of 2.  But what if I want to check for something different?

A: Exactly! The if statement condition can be anything that evaluates to true or false.  We can write a condition to make the else block run.

Q:  So if I enter a string or something besides the number 2, the else block would run?

A: Perfect!  Since JavaScript handles different data types, the if statement checks for strict equality to the number 2.

Q: How can we test this with user input?

A: We can use the prompt function to get a number from the user and store it in a variable. The if statement will then check that variable against the condition.

Q:  So the output changes based on what the user enters because it's part of the condition being checked?

A: You got it! The prompt captures user input and the if statement checks if that input is strictly equal to 2.  This determines which message gets printed.
